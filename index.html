        <p>
          The Problem of unrecycled Plastic Bottles causes a very severe issue
          for the Planet as most of the plastic bottles available for retail
          purchase are made from PET or polyethylene terephthalate. This is an
          ideal material for making single-use water bottles as it is strong,
          lightweight, and a type-1 plastic, which means it can be easily
          recycled. The recycling process has several stages; collecting bottles
          from a central location, then shredding them with other PET products,
          melting the shreds down, and reforming them into pellets. These
          pellets then act as the raw material for the production of new plastic
          goods, including new water bottles! There are many benefits to
          recycling plastic bottles and, across the globe, governments are
          taking steps to encourage both businesses and consumers to do this.
          For example, there are recycling programs running in several US
          states, (such as California, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin) which
          either encourages or makes mandatory, the commercial recycling of
          plastic bottles and other waste products. to spend funds on the
          Recycling of waste plastic bottles that are single used and thrown
          which might harm the environment and nature. That is the reason, we
          came up with this Idea with the power of Blockchain Technology.

        <p>
          We are aiming to make this world a better place for living beings, by
          reducing the use of plastic bottles which are not properly managed as
          waste material by users and cause damage to nature and the
          environment. Our first priority is to stop the use of plastic wherever
          possible and if used it should be recycled properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Whitepaper describes all about our Project, Mission, Aim,
          Features, Tokenomics, and other stuff without tons of text, just
          straight to the point. Download a copy of our Whitepaper and share it

        <p>
          Half-Empty-Bottle is a Crypto Token created on the Binance Smart Chain
          Blockchain to spend funds on the Recycling of waste plastic bottles
          that are single used and thrown which might harm the environment and
          nature. The best approach of this token is to Stop the use of Plastic
          bottles wherever possible, and if used they must be recycled and
          reused for preventing our Planet Earth from Harm.
